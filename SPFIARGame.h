 * SPFIARGame Summary:
 *
 * A container that represents a classic connect-4 game, a two players 6 by 7
 * board game (rows X columns). The container supports the following functions.

 * spFiarGameCreate           - Creates a new game board
 * spFiarGameCopy             - Copies a game board
 * spFiarGameDestroy          - Frees all memory resources associated with a game
 * spFiarGameSetMove          - Sets a move on a game board
 * spFiarGameIsValidMove      - Checks if a move is valid
 * spFiarGameUndoPrevMove     - Undoes previous move made by the last player
 * spFiarGamePrintBoard       - Prints the current board
 * spFiarGameGetCurrentPlayer - Returns the current player
